    "Jamie: Morning, Alex. The backend integration is progressing well. We’ve set up the new API endpoints and they’re working as expected. I’m currently working on optimizing the database queries. I should have it wrapped up by the end of this week.\n",

    "Alex: That sounds good. Sam, how are things on the frontend side?\n",

    "Alex: Great to hear. Taylor, any updates from the UI/UX perspective?\n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor: Yes, Alex. We’ve received some feedback from our user testing sessions. Most users found the new feature intuitive, but there were a few suggestions for improving the navigation flow. I’m working on refining the design based on this feedback. I’ll share the updated mockups by tomorrow.\n",
